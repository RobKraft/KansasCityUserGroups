#### Ideas for activities during meetings
* Have several people spend five or ten minutes each sharing tips and trips.  This is often called Lightning talks.
* Help a member solve a problem.  A member presents a problem they have and asks for suggestions for resolution.
* Share web sites, tools, and books that are good resources.
* Quick One on Ones.  Have attendees pair up and learn about each other.  Only allow five minutes to ask and share.  Possibly provide specific questions.  The have everyone shift to a new pair and do the same with someone else.  Similar to speed-dating.
* Have a vendor provide a demo of their product.
* Have a member provide a review of a product.  Pros and cons.
* Have the group volunteer their time at a civic activity helping a non-profit.
* Host an online scavenger hunt.  Have people find answers to questions, or bits of trivia.
* Performance challenge. Present a performance problem and gather suggestions for improvements.
