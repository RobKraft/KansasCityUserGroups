#### Ideas for activities during meetings
* The usual.  Have someone present a topic for 30 to 60 minutes, allowing for Q&A.
* Have several people spend five or ten minutes each sharing tips and trips.  This is often called Lightning talks.
* Help a member solve a problem.  A member presents a problem they have and asks for suggestions for resolution.
* Share web sites, tools, and books that are good resources.
* Quick One on Ones.  Have attendees pair up and learn about each other.  Only allow five minutes to ask and share.  Possibly provide specific questions.  The have everyone shift to a new pair and do the same with someone else.  Similar to speed-dating.
* Have a vendor provide a demo of their product.
* Have a member provide a review of a product.  Pros and cons.
* Have the group volunteer their time at a civic activity helping a non-profit.
* Create and run a trivia contest.
* Hold a Shark Tank of Ideas.  Let members present ideas to solve problems and have them critiqued and suggestions made by others.
* Watch a video previously recorded as a group, then discuss the content.
* Explore and learn a new tool or product or feature as a group.
