* Allow the group to use the event to donate items collected to a charity.
* Perform Survey (live polls) Q&A with the group through and SMS Q&A message service (text messages).
* Provide SWAG (gift items) to a random attendee (or all attendees)
* Use a tool like Miro (https://miro.com/) to openly collaborate in real time with all attendees.
* Create a theme for each meeting to help plan out a year of meetings.
* Form a leadership team and have each team member set the date, location, and topic for a meeting (spread the workload).
